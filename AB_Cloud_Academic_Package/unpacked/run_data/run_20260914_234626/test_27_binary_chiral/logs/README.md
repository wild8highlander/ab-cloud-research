# `logs/` — Computation Log and Console Capture of Test 27

Each line of the computation log carries the time of day and the cumulative wall-clock offset (`[23:52:57.718] [+368.746s]`), the channel tag (`calc:` for computed statistics), and the values themselves. The stdout capture preserves the suite's console output verbatim: banner, progress lines, the lettered sub-check blocks (each statistic with its pre-registered limit and outcome), and the verdict line.

This `logs/` subfolder belongs to Test 27 of the reference run; its parent folder [`../README.md`](../README.md) carries the full test description, verdicts and explanation.

## Where the full record lives

- The same log and capture ship as raw provenance copies in [`../FINAL_REPORT/logs/`](../../FINAL_REPORT/logs/README.md) — specifically its `test_27_binary_chiral/` subfolder.
- Both are embedded verbatim inside the test's own report files (`../report_27.md` and its HTML/PDF/DOCX siblings) — see [`../README.md`](../README.md), section 7–8.
- The consolidated whole-session log is [`../../FINAL_REPORT/logs/`](../../FINAL_REPORT/logs/README.md) `full_run_log.txt` (9,921 lines).
